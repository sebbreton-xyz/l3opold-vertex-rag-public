# Privacy & security FAQ (plain English)

Q: Is my data stored?
A: Documents may be stored in a private document store. The assistant should only use authorized documents.

Q: Are user questions logged?
A: Logging should minimize sensitive content. Logs are for reliability and auditing, not for collecting private data.

Q: Who can access the documents?
A: Access should be restricted by least-privilege roles and audited.

Q: Can we delete data?
A: The system should support deleting documents and re-indexing so outdated content no longer appears in answers.

Q: How do I know the answer is reliable?
A: Ask for sources. If the answer has no sources, treat it as unverified.
