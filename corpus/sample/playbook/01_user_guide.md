# User guide: how to ask good questions

## Ask specific, verifiable questions
Better: “How is sensitive data handled in logs?”
Worse: “Is the system safe?”

## Provide context
Include what matters:
- which environment (prod / staging)
- what you tried
- what outcome you want

## Ask for evidence
You can request:
- “Answer with sources”
- “Quote the policy section”
- “If not found in the docs, say ‘not found’”

## Typical question patterns
- “How do we protect data at rest and in transit?”
- “What happens when the system cannot find relevant documents?”
- “Which policy is current: A or B?”
