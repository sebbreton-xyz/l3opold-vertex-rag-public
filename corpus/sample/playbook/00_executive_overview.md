# Executive overview

This assistant answers questions by reading a private set of documents and quoting where the information comes from.
It is not a general “internet chatbot”. If the documents do not contain the answer, the assistant should say so.

## What you can expect
- Answers grounded in provided sources.
- Clear references (“sources used”) so you can verify statements.
- A consistent format and stable behavior.

## What you should NOT expect
- Guaranteed correctness without sources.
- Hidden knowledge outside the document set.
- Medical advice: the assistant only reflects the provided documentation.

## Why sources matter
Sources enable trust: you can audit what was used to produce the answer. When multiple versions exist, the assistant must follow the most current policy.
