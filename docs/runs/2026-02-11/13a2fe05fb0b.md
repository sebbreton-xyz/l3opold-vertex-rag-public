## Prompt
```text
What are the types of adverse effects that are the most problematic?
```

## Answer
The most clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) for drug-susceptible TB are hepatotoxicity, cutaneous reactions, and ocular toxicity. For drug-resistant TB, they are linezolid-associated neuropathy, myelosuppression, QT prolongation, and hepatotoxicity. These are the adverse events most likely to impact adherence, quality of life, and ultimate treatment success.

Other problematic adverse effects include:
*   Hematologic disorders like leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
*   Gastrointestinal reactions like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis
*   Skin and mucosal reactions such as rash, pruritus, and stomatitis
*   Immune-related events, especially with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as thyroid dysfunction, hepatitis, and pneumonitis
*   Hepatic and renal impairments, most commonly drug-induced hepatotoxicity and transient renal function decline
*   Hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, and cardiotoxicity

Additionally, adverse events resulting in death or hospitalization are always considered serious.
