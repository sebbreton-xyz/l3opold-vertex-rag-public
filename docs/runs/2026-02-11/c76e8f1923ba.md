## Prompt
```text
Define signal detection in pharmacovigilance, and give 3 concrete examples. Cite your sources.
```

## Answer
Signal detection in pharmacovigilance involves using standardized metrics to identify potential safety risks associated with drugs. These metrics are recommended by organizations like the World Health Organization and the US FDA to ensure consistent and reliable detection across studies. Four common methods used are Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS).

Here are three examples of signal detection criteria:

1.  **ROR**: A signal is considered positive if the lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) is > 1 [3].
2.  **PRR**: A positive signal is identified when PRR > 2 and χ² > 4 [1].
3.  **BCPNN**: A signal is identified when IC025 > 0, where IC025 is the lower limit of the Information Component [1].
